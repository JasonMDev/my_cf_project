This is CareerFoundry Project.
This is the first Achievement
The main objective is to build a Responsive Portfolio Website

##Your Project Goals
Now look at the three columns titled "Heading" in the CareerFoundry template. You will add information about your services, skills, process, or other marketing information in the next few lessons, but for now, replace the titles inside the <h2> headings with "Portfolio Concept," "Project Goals," and "Course Goals" for your mentor. Inside the <p> tags, insert the following content:

##For "Portfolio Concept," take a few minutes to think about YOUR portfolio site and outline the content you want to include. If you already have some web development experience and some prior projects, this is the opportunity to highlight them. If you have work from another industry, you can provide those of examples of your professional experience as well. If you have any design elements in mind, you can record these as well. Your mentor might be able to help you find images, fonts, or other elements for your site.
For "Project Goals," include any details about deadlines you want to meet and time you can commit each week.
For "Course Goals," write down your professional learning goals. Are you changing careers, or advancing your existing skill set? Do you want to become a freelancer after this course? Get hired as an entry level developer? Your course goals will be tied closely to your project goals.
